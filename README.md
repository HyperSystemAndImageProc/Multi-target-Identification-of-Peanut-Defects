# Multi-target-Identification-of-Peanut-Defects
Multi-target identification of peanut defects based on multispectral imaging system and improved faster RCN
For Peanut Defects Identification, we provide the source code for the network structure, based on: Python 3.6, Keras 2.2.4

This dataset is provided by Power Systems Engineering Research Center, Ministry of Education, College of Big Data and Information Engineering, Guizhou University and its main information is as follows:
(1) The dataset contains samples of healthy peanuts, mouldy peanuts, mechanically damaged peanuts and sprouted peanuts.
(2) The data contains a total of 1300 sets of multispectral images, each set contains 3 multispectral channels (440nm, 470nm, 520nm respectively);
(3) The size of each image is 646 * 482 pixel.
(4) The dataset supports the PacVoc 2012 format for parsing.

If you wish to acquire a single channel multispectral image, you can convert it using the "RGB2singlechannel.m" script, which is stored in the "Assets" folder. Of course, you can also contact us for the raw data.
